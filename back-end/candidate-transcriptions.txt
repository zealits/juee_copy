[2025-05-08T03:56:42.776Z] variable variable is
[2025-05-08T03:56:46.871Z] anything like we just give a name to a variable variable means
[2025-05-08T03:56:49.965Z] it holds a value which we define
[2025-05-08T03:56:55.084Z] so that's available which can port a value
[2025-05-08T03:56:57.172Z] it can be vendor do like in float and anything

[2025-05-08T03:57:42.799Z] and also with the help of python because it's dynamic programming
[2025-05-08T03:57:44.749Z] the more focus is
[2025-05-08T03:57:49.978Z] not not on like giving definite defining every other variable
[2025-05-08T03:57:54.159Z] but the more focus in designing complex algorithms with is
[2025-05-08T03:57:57.237Z] so that's one characteristic which i say okay
